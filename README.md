# CatchBot
For this project our goal was to create a system that used a speedometer and stepper motor to catch a ball that is launched of a table. We used an Arduino UNO for this project.

Here is our spreadsheet of data that shows our speedometer calibration and accuracy: <img width="428" height="193" alt="speedospread" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68799658-1bc1-4666-b16f-f642f4e14861" />

Here is our circuit diagram of our project:

For the bellow image, not all components are exact due to lack of available options in software.
Main diffrence is motor driver
